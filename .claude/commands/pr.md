```

### 2. Check PR Status

```bash
gh pr status
gh pr view
```

### 3. Update PR

```bash

git push

# Update PR description
gh pr edit --body "Updated description..."

## Common PR Title Patterns

- `Feature: Add [feature name]`
- `Fix: [brief description of fix]`
- `Refactor: [what was refactored]`
- `Update: [what was updated]`
- `Remove: [what was removed]`

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive PR titles with prefixes
- Include comprehensive test plan with checkboxes
- Link related issues with `Closes #123`
- Request specific reviewers with `--reviewer username`
- Use draft PRs for work in progress: `--draft`
- Run linting and tests before creating PR
