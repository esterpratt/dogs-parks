The user will provide a component file. Your job is to create 4 design options for the component:

1. Create the design options in 4 different tsx + scss modules files.

- The file names should be the name of the component following a number, for example: [componentName]1.tsx.

2. Each design should be different in the core aspects.

- For example: if the design includes a selection between options:

* design 1 should include a dropdown
* design 2 should include a row of buttons
* design 3 should include a column of buttons
* design 4 should include another idea that you will think about

3. The design options should follow the general UI of the app:

- The design vibe is simple but playful
- Use the same colors of the app
- Use the same borders / border-radius / box-shadows etc. of other components in the app.
- If possible, core UI like buttons, inputs, should be taken from the app components.
- Support dark mode

4. The files should follow the code standards of the app.
5. You shouldn't install any external library.
6. For icons, you can use lucid-react.
