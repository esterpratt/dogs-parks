The user will provide a component file or a feature plan. Your job is to create 5 design options:

- If the user provides a component, create 5 design options for the component.
- If the user provides a feature plan, analyze the JSX that needs to be added/created, and create 4 design options based on it. In such a case, you need to also add the JSX itself. Your freedom of placement of the JSX is based on the plan.

Requirements:

1. Create the design options in 5 different tsx + scss modules files.

- The file names should be the name of the component following a number, for example: [componentName]1.tsx.

2. Each design should be different in the core aspects.

- For example: if the design includes a selection between options, the designs should include different ways of selecting options, such as dropdown, buttons in a row, buttons in a column, etc.

3. The design options should follow the general UI of the app:

- The design vibe is simple but playful
- Use the same colors of the app
- Use the same borders / border-radius / box-shadows etc. of other components in the app.
- If possible, core UI like buttons, inputs, should be taken from the app components.
- Support dark mode

4. The files should follow the code standards of the app.
5. You shouldn't install any external library.
6. For icons, you can use lucid-react.
