# KlavHub current context

Short bootstrap and handoff; Notion is the task source of truth. Permanent coding instructions live in `AGENTS.md`. Release and prior-work status below reflect the user-provided handoff.

## Current state

- Backlog review completed on 2026-09-21. The next feature is shared **dog ownership**; the prior park-ownership interpretation was incorrect.
- Recent park-details and modal-submit fixes were completed, verified, merged into `main`, and pushed.
- iOS 1.2.4 (build 12) was uploaded and submitted to Apple.
- Android 1.0.9 (versionCode 11) was uploaded to Google Play checks.
- Store review and publication status may need follow-up.
- The database is the source of truth for park data; park sizes are `small`, `medium`, `large`, and `huge`.
- Device-token registration was fixed using `api_upsert_device_token`.
- Missing park details use the secured `api_update_missing_park_details` RPC.
- Existing Supabase migrations must not be edited or rerun; see `AGENTS.md` for database change rules.

## Notion connection and task workflow

Connected to **ester prat's Notion** through the existing Notion tools; read access verified. The user identified [Dogs Parks](https://app.notion.com/p/0a4024c603da464487a7a0823ab8b3cc) as the KlavHub task database. Data source: `collection://0fe99187-19a5-4c1c-bf6c-1497977a1074`.

- Ticket title: `TODO`; progress: `Status` (`Not started`, `In progress`, `Done`); category: `Subject`; scheduling: `When`.
- Existing categories: `Next Steps`, `Tech Debt for App`, `For Next Version`, `To Learn in Next Version Tasks`, `Tech Debt for Learning`, `JIRA`, `Bug`.
- No dedicated priority field or project relation exists. Keep priority rationale in ticket content; database membership identifies the project.
- Read the unfiltered table view (`view://7a266ef8-da36-4b5a-a259-f71b224d4b0f`) with pagination, then fetch candidate ticket bodies before selecting or changing tickets. On 2026-09-21, reviewed all 136 existing non-archived row summaries, all 20 open ticket bodies, and three relevant completed ticket bodies; created four missing handoff tickets afterward.
- Before creating a ticket, check existing titles and relevant bodies for overlap. Create missing tickets in this data source using existing categories and `Not started`.
- Set `In progress` when implementation starts; record implementation notes, verification, and decisions in the ticket body while preserving existing content. Set `Done` only when the agreed work is complete. Record architectural proposals and user decisions in the relevant feature ticket.
- Notion read and write access verified. Four handoff tickets were created as `Not started`; existing ticket content, statuses, and database schema were preserved. Do not duplicate the database or change its schema without explanation and approval.

Immediate next step: finish shared dog ownership product decisions and screen flows with the user, then audit the live dog schema, RLS, RPCs, storage policies and account-deletion behavior before implementation. The Notion ticket distinguishes confirmed choices from proposals. General reliability and duplicate-report work are separate backlog tasks, not established blockers for this feature.

## Reconciled handoff tasks

- [Central write timeout and offline behavior](https://app.notion.com/p/3e24e04c2ff181128aa3f233846c8e3d): acceptance criteria include late success, safe retry, duplicate prevention, and Web/iOS/Android coverage. No runtime tests performed during review.
- [Gradual Supabase type adoption](https://app.notion.com/p/3e24e04c2ff1817b8cc0fcf6b870dfdb): retain UI domain types and map actual database results. Prior 66-error/22-file count is handoff information, not a fresh result.
- [New park suggestion save test](https://app.notion.com/p/3e24e04c2ff181558180d47cfcd658dc): deferred and nonblocking; separate from the completed confirmation-modal ticket.
- Existing [duplicate review reports](https://app.notion.com/p/1b44e04c2ff18061a7bdf7f1807541e8) and [upside-down mobile photos](https://app.notion.com/p/2344e04c2ff180cf933ec82667918ec9) remain open. Live database uniqueness and current photo reproduction were not verified. The old completed Security ticket concerns Firebase and does not establish current Supabase authorization safety.
- Store publication status remains unverified. Redesign and React Native migration are separate open backlog items, not authorized scope expansions.

## Next major feature: shared dog ownership

Discovery is recorded in [the corrected ownership planning ticket](https://app.notion.com/p/3e24e04c2ff1810592a3cb0f61d736d4). Several users should share one dog profile; a user may still have multiple dogs. Confirmed by the user:

- One primary owner plus co-owners, with shared day-to-day editing as the working model.
- Support both invitations (recipient accepts) and ownership requests.
- All owners upload and select the main photo; co-owners delete their own uploads; primary can delete any photo.
- Delete the dog profile only when the primary is the sole owner; leaving ownership is separate.

Repository findings: dog queries use a single `dogs.owner`; image paths and their cached owner ID depend on that owner; dog edit controls depend on navigation state. Account deletion removes the user's storage folder, including dog photos. The live schema, policies, RPC definitions and deployed account-deletion authorization remain unverified.

Proposed design: dog-owner membership records, atomic membership/transfer operations, images stored by stable dog ID with uploader metadata, and an Owners screen with focused invitation/request/transfer/leave modals. No application or database changes have been made.

Open decisions include public owner visibility, transfer acceptance and old primary's role, account deletion/unavailable primary recovery, membership removal versus deletion protection, invitation eligibility/expiry, and legacy photo attribution. The detailed plan and verification stages live in Notion. Do not implement until the user reviews the remaining product and authorization rules.

## Continuity rule

At the end of each completed project task:

1. Update the relevant Notion ticket once connected.
2. Keep this file concise, recording only current state, unresolved decisions, and the immediate next step.
3. Remove obsolete details rather than accumulating a chronological log.
